 The front-end-of-line (FEOL) is the first portion of IC fabrication where the individual components like transistors, capacitors, resistors, etc.  are fabricated in the semiconductor. 
FEOL Consist of Chemical Mechanical Polishing a.k.a Polarization and Cleaning of The Wafer.
Shallow Trench Isolation (STI) or LOCOS (tech node > 0.25 μm) Comes Under FEOL.
FEOL Also Include Well Formation , Gate Module Formation, Source and Drain Module Formation
## Doping with acceptor and donor atoms
### ion implantation 
    - used to dope
    - bombard the substrate througt a thin layer of screening SiO2
### Annealing
### Threshold voltage adjustment implantation
    - implainting ions on selective transistors to change Threshold voltages of singular transistors
